Dumping Variables
*****************

Every debugger is familiar with the [php:var_dump] function, which prints detailed information about a variable. Unfortunately, its output lacks HTML formatting and merges into a single line, not to mention HTML escaping issues. In practice, it's necessary to replace `var_dump` with a more convenient function. That function is `dump()`.

```php
$arr = [10, 20.2, true, null, 'hello'];

dump($arr);
// or Debugger::dump($arr);
```

generates the output:

[* dump-basic.webp *]

You can change the default light theme to dark:

```php
Debugger::$dumpTheme = 'dark';
```

[* dump-dark.webp *]

You can also change the nesting depth using [Debugger::$maxDepth |api:Tracy\Debugger::$maxDepth] and the length of displayed strings using [Debugger::$maxLength |api:Tracy\Debugger::$maxLength]. Naturally, lower values speed up rendering.

```php
Debugger::$maxDepth = 2; // default: 3
Debugger::$maxLength = 50; // default: 150
```

The `dump()` function can display additional useful information. The constant `Tracy\Dumper::LOCATION_SOURCE` adds a tooltip with the path to the file where the function was called. `Tracy\Dumper::LOCATION_LINK` provides a link to that location. `Tracy\Dumper::LOCATION_CLASS` adds a tooltip to each dumped object showing the path to the file where its class is defined. These constants are set in the `Debugger::$showLocation` variable before calling `dump()`. To set multiple values simultaneously, combine them using the `|` operator.

```php
Debugger::$showLocation = Tracy\Dumper::LOCATION_SOURCE; // Sets only the display of the call location
Debugger::$showLocation = Tracy\Dumper::LOCATION_CLASS | Tracy\Dumper::LOCATION_LINK; // Sets both the link display and the path to the class
Debugger::$showLocation = false; // Disables the display of additional information
Debugger::$showLocation = true; // Enables the display of all additional information
```

Practical alternatives to `dump()` are `dumpe()` (dump & exit) and `bdump()`. The latter allows us to dump variable values in the Tracy Bar panel. This is very convenient, as the dumps are separate from the page layout, and we can also add a title to them.

```php
bdump([2, 4, 6, 8], 'even numbers up to ten');
bdump([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 'odd numbers up to ten');
```
