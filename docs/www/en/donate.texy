Sponsor Nette Development
*************************

<div class=backing-text>
Anyone who builds applications on Nette has an interest in seeing the framework actively evolve. To support new PHP versions. To fix bugs. To introduce "new features":https://blog.nette.org/en/what-is-coming-in-the-next-versions that simplify work or save time and money. To ensure the framework has excellent documentation and that useful content, such as articles, tutorials, or videos, is available.

Many parts of Nette are world-class, and we want to keep it that way.

Without adequate funding, none of this can be guaranteed. Yet, ensuring future versions are released requires relatively little: your support, even with a small monthly contribution.

Join us and become a Nette partner!

You will ensure the healthy functioning of the project you rely on. At the same time, **you'll receive a host of exclusive benefits** (see *Partnership Levels* in the right column). You'll gain access to bonus content and technical support. You'll increase the priority of resolving your issues. And you'll also enhance your company's visibility and attract developers.

How do we increase your visibility? For example, by displaying your logo on this website (i.e., on this page, the homepage, in the documentation, on the forum, and on a [special page |https://nette.org/en/partners]). You will have the opportunity to post [job offers |https://forum.nette.org/en/f30-jobs], advertise on the forum ([sample |https://forum.nette.org/cs/30798-problem-s-cizim-klicem-pri-mazani#p198093]) or in the documentation ([sample |https://doc.nette.org/en/application/components#toc-flash-messages]), reaching the Nette developer community effectively.

We issue invoices to partners so they can include the support in their expenses, either monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.
