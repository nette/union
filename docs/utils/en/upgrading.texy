Upgrading
*********


Migrating from 3.x to 4.0
=========================

The minimum required PHP version is 8.0.

The `Nette\Utils\Reflection` class provided methods `getParameterType()`, `getPropertyType()`, and `getReturnType()` for working with types. These methods were created when PHP didn't have union, intersection, or the newest disjunctive normal form types, with which they no longer work correctly. They have been replaced by the [Type class |utils:type]. As of version 4.0, these methods have been removed.

The method `Nette\Utils\Reflection::getParameterDefaultValue()` is deprecated because the native `ReflectionParameter::getDefaultValue()` now works correctly.

The variable `Nette\Utils\Html::$xhtml` has been removed.


Finder
------

Finder has moved to the `nette/utils` package. Remove the original `nette/finder` package:

```shell
composer remove nette/finder
```

On Linux, Finder now operates in case-sensitive mode by default.

In the previous version, the `exclude()` and `filter()` methods behaved differently depending on whether they were called **before** or **after** `from()` or `in()`. This is no longer the case; `exclude()` and `filter()` always function the same way. The behavior of `filter()` called *after* `from()`/`in()` is now handled by the new method `descentFilter()`.

Finder no longer implements the `Countable` interface.

A string starting with a slash in `Finder::findFiles('/f*')` is now considered an absolute path. If you intended a relative path from the current directory, replace it with, for example, `Finder::findFiles('./f*')`.

If a directory you are searching in does not exist, `Nette\InvalidStateException` is thrown (instead of the previous `UnexpectedValueException`).
